# Exception handling
This project is a library management system implemented in Java, utilizing exception handling to manage errors. 
Users can add books, borrow, return, and list available books. Custom exceptions handle cases such as missing books or an empty library. 
Various classes manage books and library operations, while try-catch blocks ensure the program runs smoothly without crashing in case of errors.
